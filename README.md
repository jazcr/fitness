<br>
<br> When you first start out with this app, you will have to add a workout using the "New Workout" button. You must choose between "Cardio" and "Resistance" when creating your workout and fill in the blanks of the form. You can choose to add more workouts or choose "Complete". This will take you back to the Fitness Tracker home page that gives you your stats for the day. If you navigate to the Dashboard, there are graphs automatically made for you that show both the duration of your workouts and the combined weight you lifted.
